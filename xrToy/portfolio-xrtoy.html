                <h3>1. Hands-Free Toys</h3>
            <p>
                The first type of toys are toys that don't require you to move your hands at all. 
                In the video to the right, every time the guitar gets plucked, a sample is played 
                according to where the user looks.

            <h3>2. Hybrid Toys</h3>
            <p>
                The second type of toys combine a virtual object with a real-world instrument. 
                You have to interact with both to get the desired sound. 
                In the video to the right, depending on where balls are in orbit, the piano played 
                will sound different.

                <p>
                    The third type of toys are purely virtual. These are virtual objects. 
                    In the video on the right, you can play a pitch depending on where you hold your hand.

        <h2>Context:</h2>
        <p>
            This is a project I worked on during my internship at <strong>DAE Research</strong> in 2024.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project was set up by <strong>Dries Vienne</strong> and <strong>Dylan De Waele</strong> at 
            <strong>DAE Research</strong> before I worked on it.

        <h2>Reflection:</h2>
        <p>
            Because of the goal of exploring possibilities, I got more comfortable planning on the go. 
            It felt like a very long prototyping session, which made it even more fun and interesting.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was also nice to showcase these projects at expos and get fun ideas from attendees sharing their thoughts.
