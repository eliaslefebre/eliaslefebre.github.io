            <h1>3 Museos Game Project</h1>
            <p><span class="highlight">Description:</span> The request for this game came from <strong>3 Museos</strong>, and thanks to DAE's applied games program, we had the chance to collaborate on this endeavor. Over a span of approximately four months, a team of six individuals, including myself, worked on this project. The primary objective was to create an enjoyable and educational game that visitors to a museum in Mexico could enjoy.</p>
    
            <h2>My Contribution:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Programming in C#</li>
                <li>SFX creation</li>
                <li>Foley recording and editing</li>
                <li>Music composition</li>
                <li>Audio implementation in Unity</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h2>Challenges:</h2>
            <p>This game inspired me to delve deeper into <strong>Sound Design</strong>. It was the first project I designed sounds for, and I found it easy to get into a flow when working on audio. Thanks to this project, I decided to switch majors from Independent Game Development to Sound Design after this year.</p>
            <p>It was my first opportunity to become familiar with the process of sound design, sound implementation, and music implementation. I built a strong foundation during this project, which I further honed in the years to come.</p>
