            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This project was created with the goal of investigating how <strong>Extended Reality (XR)</strong> 
                could be integrated into the process of mixing <strong>spatial audio</strong> in a 
                <strong>Digital Audio Workstation (DAW)</strong> and exploring the potential benefits of such a setup.
            </p>
            <p>
                To conduct this research, I developed an <strong>XR application in Unity</strong> that connected to a 
                <strong>DAW (Reaper)</strong> over a local network using <strong>OSC (Open Sound Control)</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Below, you can find a video showcasing the final result. On the left, you can see the spatialization plugins 
                that exist in the DAW. These spatialization plugins are visualized in the XR interface as orbs around a head 
                that represents the listener. Each orb spatializes an instrument, with the instrument's name displayed below 
                the spatialization window.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the right, you can see a simulation of what one might experience in the XR interface. The track being moved 
                in this demonstration is the drum track. With headphones, you can hear the spatialization effect
                as the orb is moved.

            <h2>Context: </h2>
                <p>
                    This project was created as part of my graduation work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I thoroughly enjoyed my graduation work because of the autonomy it provided 
                    and the opportunity to push boundaries with creativity.

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>
                I am very proud of this work as it allowed me to step out of my comfort zone. 
                Planning-wise, I was a bit overconfident with what I could achieve in the given time. 
                While I had to cut away a few features, the core idea ended up working fine.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>P.S. Thank you to DAE Research for letting me use their equipment during this project. I really appreciate it.</em>
